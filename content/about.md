# Blitz of the Hidden Soldiers

Blitz of The Hidden Soldiers (BoTHS), a game of incomplete information, blends the strategic depth of traditional chess with the intrigue of hidden moves and pieces. This project will implement a blind chess game on the Topos testnet, leveraging ZKPs to obscure board positions. The primary collectible, donums (Latin for gifts), bestow unique abilities upon players. In this immersive gaming experience, each player is distinctly identified by their public blockchain address, ensuring transparency and security throughout the gameplay.

This is the DevLog for BoTHS!
